<h3 align="center">Purwadhika Final Project</h3>

The housing market is one of the most crucial components of any national economy. Hence, observations of the housing market and accurate predictions of real estate prices are helpful for real estate buyers and sellers as well as economic specialists. It is crucial for the establishment of real estate policies and can help real estate owners and agents make informative decision. However, real estate forecasting is a complicated and difficult task owing to many direct and indirect factors that inevitably influence the accuracy of predictions.

The aim of this project is to employ actual transaction data and machine learning models to predict prices of housing in Washington, D.C., which is the capital of the United States. The actual transaction data contain attributes and transaction prices of real estate that respectively serve as independent variables and dependent variables for machine learning models.
