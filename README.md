## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
The housing market is one of the most crucial components of any national economy. Hence, observations of the housing market and accurate predictions of real estate prices are helpful for real estate buyers and sellers as well as economic specialists. It is crucial for the establishment of real estate policies and can help real estate owners and agents make informative decision. However, real estate forecasting is a complicated and difficult task owing to many direct and indirect factors that inevitably influence the accuracy of predictions.
## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
The main idea of this project is to employ actual transaction data and machine learning models to predict prices of housing in Washington, D.C., which is the capital of the United States. The actual transaction data needs to have the attributes and transaction prices of the real estate that respectively serve as independent variables and dependent variables for machine learning models.

This project uses an open source dataset, which include 48 explanatory features and 158,957 entries of housing sales in Washington, D.C from 1947 to  2018. The data is available at [Open Data D.C.](https://opendata.dc.gov/) and the residential and address point data is managed by the [Office of the Chief Technology Officer](https://octo.dc.gov/).
