        "- Excellent Condition - All items that can normally be repaired or refinished have recently been corrected, such as new roofing, paint, furance overhaul, state of the art components, etc. With no functional inadequacies of any consequence and all major short-lived components in like-new condition, the overall effective age has been substantially reduced upon complete revitilization of the structure regardless of the actual chronological age.\n",
        "- Very Good Condition - All items well maintained, many having been overhauled and repaired as they’ve showed signs of wear, increasing the life expectancy and lowering the effective age with little deterioration or obsolesence evident with a high degree of utility.\n",
        "- Good Condition - No obvious maintenance required but neither is everything new. Appearance and utility are above the standard and the overall effective age will be lower than the typical property.\n",
        "- Average Condition - Some evidence of deferred maintenance and normal obsolescence with age in that a few minor repairs are needed along with some refinishing. But with all major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy, effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.\n",
        "- Fair Condition (Badly worn) - Much repair needed. Many items need refinishing or overhauling, deferred maintenance obvious, inadequate building utility and services all shortening the life expectancy and increasing the effective age.\n",
        "- Poor Condition (Worn Out) - Repair and overall needed on painted surfaces, roofing, plumbing, heating, numerous functional inadequacies, substandard utilities etc. (found only in extraordinary circumstances). Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction, reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.\n"
